                                                         *Veiled Technocratic Supremacy*

Veiled Technocratic Supremacy is an attempt to visualise the control and surveillance powers organisations, governments, and the wealthy all have at their disposal. The past few years, I have personally started to realise the depth and severity of how all of our actions are almost all tracked and traceable by organisations/companies , from data stored from social media companies to what we purchased at Tesco on a random Saturday morning. 

Subsequently, there is the insight to how our data is economically weaponised by data storage companies in which are bought, sold, and traded at constant bidding wars. Beyond that, our devices we trust and use on a daily basis, either it be for social media or work purposes, kept in our physical vicinities of where we sleep, are also veiled tracking tags. If an organisation or anyone up the almost-dystopian and enigmatic hierarchy wants to find you, they can and will.
