                                       Silent Hill, The "Leave Ending"

With direct inspiration from the Notion Movement example, I added a little touch of a personal influence from my gaming perspective. 
Silent Hill is an emotional rollercoaster, and this scene connected with me. I attempted to visualize the converstaion James and Mary
had. 

One of the harder parts of this line of code was attempting to play the audio on start up but will only work the first few times on start up.
Adding a new font was the funnest part. The hardest part would be selecting the last phrase in the array and display it red, just by adding 
another if/else statement did the trick. 

If the audio does not play initially locally, a better listening experience would be to match the audio to the start of the window opening,
