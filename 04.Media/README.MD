                                            Cyberpunk Load-up                                           

This simple piece of code, inspired by my favourite game Cyberpunk 2077, using the Samurai icon as a loading effect with a loading gif in the top right.

The hardest part of this code was to position the gifs and also looping the sound effect, the p5 reference sheet helped out.
